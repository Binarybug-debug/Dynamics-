We have downloaded this dataset for you and stored it in this repository.\n",

        "4. `newspaper`: the amount of money (in thousands of dollars) spent on newspaper ads\n",
        "\n",
        "So, for example:\n",
        "- the **third number** from each list represents the value of `sales`, `tv`, `radio`, and `newspaper` in **one** market,\n",
