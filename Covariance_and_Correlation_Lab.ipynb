        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "\n",

        "- Calculate covariance and correlation  \n",
        "- Declare and use a function with arguments   \n",

        "## The Data\n",
        "\n",
        "The two variables include 20 heights (in inches) and weights (in pounds). This will help us focus more on seeing covariance and correlation in action!\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point, you should be able to calculate the average height and average weight. You can also explain the medians, variances, and standard deviations for this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "But all of those measurements are only concerned with a **single variable**. Now that we have both heights and weights, we want to perform statistical analysis for **multiple variables**. In this lab, you'll answer the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Is there a linear relationship between weight an height?\n",
        "2. Does weight increase as height increases?\n",
        "3. How strong is the linear relationship between weight and height?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are always exceptions, but when you look at the population in general, taller people will tend to weigh more than shorter people. While you should *always* be cautious when generalizing, generalization of information can be very useful as it shows you a bigger picture that you can build your intuitions upon. This is also what a lot of core statistical principles are built upon.\n",

The idea is that you take each element in $X$ and $Y$ and respectively subtract the mean of $X$ and $Y$. The result is that your altered (\"normalized\") $X$ and $Y$ now have mean 0.\n",
